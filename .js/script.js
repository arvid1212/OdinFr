Q:
Name the three ways to declare a variable

A: Var,Let,Const

Q:
Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
A:

Var is outdated, Let is more modern, Const is only unchangeable variables
Q:
What rules should you follow when naming variables?
A: lowercase, easy to understand, no reserevd names
Q:
What happens when you add numbers and strings together? 
A: numbers become strings
Q:
How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?   '

A: Show whats left in the bigger number division  
Q:
Explain the difference between == and ===.
A:
// == same name, === same type
Q
When would you receive a NaN result?
A: When you have not declared a varible number
Q:
How do you increment and decrement a number?
A: 
Let counter = 2
counter++;
counter--;
Q:
Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.

A: 

If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in which form to use:

If we’d like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form:

If we’d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:

Q:
What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?

A: From school, we all know that the multiplication in the expression 1 + 2 * 2 should be calculated before the addition. That’s exactly the precedence thing. The multiplication is said to have a higher precedence than the addition.

Parentheses override any precedence, so if we’re not satisfied with the default order, we can use them to change it. For example, write (1 + 2) * 2.

Q:

How do you log information to the console?
What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”

A: The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
